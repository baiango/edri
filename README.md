# Edri - Extended Dynamic Range Image
 
The EXR is taking too much space for my drive. Or on the cloud drive. My drive can't store it.  
So this was borned to compress the HDRI better.

# Compiling
[Odin requirements](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/#requirements)  
[Get Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases/tag/dev-2023-05)  
To compile and run it, use `odin run .` in the project folder root.  
You need to set the PATH for Odin to be available anywhere in the cmd.  
Put the Odin binary in the C:\odin.
You can find and set the PATH environment variable Win+S and search path.
